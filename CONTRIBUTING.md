Although **SquidEyes.Futures** is mostly for the author's own purposes, it should be fairly easy to add additional functionality to the library, if desired.  Just note that a few simple rules will need to be followed when submitting a pull-request:

* Be sure to include a copy of the standard license header in each new source code file you create (see Futures.sln.headertest, in the root of the solution)
* No changes to the solution-wide .editorconfig file will be accepted
* Pull-requests will not be accepted without a full-coverage unit-test for new or updated functionality
 
NOTE: the basic (pun intended!) idea behind SquidEyes.Futures is to provide a collection of helper classes and extensions that are widely applicable trading applications and with zero out-of-the-box dependencies.  Please try to hew to that intent when making pull-requests.
